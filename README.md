This is a Java game where two players guess a random number. The computer generates a number, players guess, and get hints until one player guesses correctly. The winner is the one who guessed with the least attempts. Players can choose to play again or end the game
Two players will participate in the game, and they will take turns guessing a number that the computer has randomly generated.

The computer will generate a random number between a set range (for example, 1 to 100) at the start of the game, and keep it a secret from both players.

The first player will make their guess, and the computer will check whether their guess matches the secret number. If it does not, the computer will tell the player to guess a higher or lower number, depending on whether their guess was too high or too low.

The second player will then make their guess, and the computer will repeat the process of checking whether their guess matches the secret number, and telling them to guess higher or lower if necessary.

The players will take turns making guesses until one of them correctly guesses the secret number. The winner will be the player who guessed the correct number in the least number of attempts.

After the winner has been declared, the players can choose to play the game again with a new randomly generated number.

The game will end if the players choose not to play again, or if there is an error or issue that prevents the game from continuing.

In this Java-based number guessing game, two players take turns guessing a randomly generated number. The computer generates a random number within a specified range at the start of the game, which is kept secret from both players. Each player makes their guess, and the computer checks whether the guess matches the secret number. If it doesn't, the computer provides a hint whether the player should guess a higher or lower number. The game continues until one of the players correctly guesses the secret number, and the winner is the player who guessed the correct number in the least number of attempts. The players can choose to play the game again with a new randomly generated number after a winner has been declared. The game will end if the players choose not to play again or if there is an error that prevents the game from continuing.
